## About the language:
Flat is a Python-like language with dynamic type system, indentation structuring and is case-sensitive.
But it has got syntax different from all other languages:   

### Functions:
Functions can be called like that:
`function: arg, arg`
For example `print` function may be called like:   
`print: "Hello world, the magic number is ", 3.14159265`   
No more brackets.   
No more semicolons at end of line.   

But how to separate different function arguments? 
It can be done like that:   `print: "Your name is ", input: "Enter your name: "; "."`
